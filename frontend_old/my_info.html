        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings! I am a passionate developer dedicated to automation and modular solutions to issues I find
            interesting. These
            are my personal projects and this account only holds my non-professional codebases. Please comment, fork and
            contribute
            as you see fit. I am always looking for ways to improve my code and learn new things.

                    <p>I'm working on Python, Rust and Go based data tool packs that enable data science and analytics
                        professionals to access different platforms (e.g. Snowflake, RDS, AWS S3, Vault, Databricks)
                        easily without all the setup. This initiative seeks to empower users with efficient and
                        high-performance tools for data processing, analysis, and visualization.</p>

                    <p>A smart eBook renaming and organization tool that processes messy ebook folders and uses a local

                        (no internet or accounts required) to identify metadata like author, series, series order, and
                        title. It restructures
                        your library into a clean, nested format by author and series. Built for full local use, but
                        easily swappable to OpenAI
                        or other APIs if desired.</p>

                    <p>My work involves creating a dotfile synchronization application. This tool empowers me to apply
                        settings to
                        non-configurable applications on mobile devices through AHK, Tasker, and iOS actions. This will
                        also pull configurations over SSH or SCP from devices that generally dont support symlinking
                        into a git repo like my router and unraid server. The goal is to achieve a consistent experience
                        across platforms.

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>This project provides high school students in Georgetown, Texas, with a structured backend while
                        allowing them full creative control over the frontend. The backend, built in Go with Fiber,
                        dynamically serves pages without requiring container rebuilds. It is deployed via Docker Compose
                        on a Linux server, reverse-proxied through SWAG, and managed with Cloudflare and DuckDNS.
                        Students handle the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring they can iterate freely without backend
                        constraints. This setup fosters student-led development while maintaining a stable and scalable
                        foundation.</p>

                        line-ending conversions, local discovery, and sync change management. Additionally, I'm

                    <p>I'm developing a 2D game with my wonderful wife using C# and the Unity engine. This project aims

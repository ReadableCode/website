        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings! I am a passionate developer dedicated to automation and modular solutions to issues I find
            interesting. These
            are my personal projects and this account only holds my non-professional codebases. Please comment, fork and
            contribute
            as you see fit. I am always looking for ways to improve my code and learn new things.

                        into a git repo like my router and unraid server. The goal is to achieve a consistent experience
                        across platforms.

                    <p>This project provides high school students in Georgetown, Texas, with a structured backend while

                        dynamically serves pages without requiring container rebuilds. It is deployed via Docker Compose
                        on a Linux server, reverse-proxied through SWAG, and managed with Cloudflare and DuckDNS.
                        Students handle the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring they can iterate freely without backend
                        constraints. This setup fosters student-led development while maintaining a stable and scalable
                        foundation.</p>
